## ARCHITECTURE & SYSTEM DESIGN EXPERIENCE
- Designed highly available, horizontally scalable backend systems capable of handling production traffic spikes.
- Implemented observability across services using structured logging, tracing, and monitoring dashboards.
- Applied resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, bulkheads, and graceful degradation.
- Designed service boundaries using domain-driven design (DDD) and event storming techniques.
- Ensured API governance, versioning strategy, and backward compatibility for mobile and frontend clients.
- Performed capacity planning, load analysis, and optimized for low-latency, high-throughput operations.

- Event‑driven microservices with Kafka for parcel lifecycle tracking and internal communication.
- Distributed retry/backoff engine using PostgreSQL queues, Spring @Scheduled tasks, and ShedLock.
- Scalable REST API design with idempotency, clear domain boundaries, and backward‑compatible evolution.
- Migration from monolith to microservices with domain refactoring and decoupled service responsibilities.
- Cloud migrations to Azure Kubernetes with reverse proxy routing, blue‑green deployments, and secure access.
- Database restructuring from shared public schema to application‑specific schemas.
- Payment integration architecture for Adyen & NETS (recurring + scheduled payments).

## EXPERIENCE
### **Senior Backend Developer — Posten Bring AS (TCS)**  
**Nov 2019 – Present**  
Technologies: Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, React, Azure DevOps, Liquibase, GitHub Actions

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed and owned backend microservices for logistics operations, parcel tracking, and user services.
- Built real‑time parcel event ingestion using Kafka, enabling improved tracking accuracy.
- Integrated secure payment flows with Adyen & NETS supporting recurring and scheduled payments.
- Migrated multiple legacy services to Azure Kubernetes and PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
- Ensured GDPR compliance within user services and optimized DB queries to remove performance bottlenecks.
- Actively contributed to architectural improvements and modernization of CI/CD pipelines.

**Scale & Impact:** Services used by **7M+ users** and process **millions of parcel events daily**.

## SELECTED PROJECTS
### **Distributed Event Retry Engine with Scheduled Backoff**
- Built a PostgreSQL‑backed retry queue storing failures with metadata (retry count, delay, reason).  
- Implemented dynamic backoff logic (10s → 30s → 5m → 30m → 1h) and ensured single‑pod execution using ShedLock.  
- Reduced manual intervention and improved eventual consistency across external API integrations.

### **Payment Idempotency for Purchase API (Adyen/NETS)**
- Eliminated double charges on iOS by introducing idempotency keys and safe retry behaviour.  
- Removed 100% of duplicate payments and reduced customer service workload.

### **Parcel Tracking & Parcel Sharing Services**
- Developed services enabling users to track parcels, share pickup permissions, and manage deliveries in apps.  
- Enhanced reliability using Kafka‑based event pipelines.

### **PostgreSQL Migration to Azure + Liquibase Modernization**
- Migrated large legacy DB to Azure Flexible Server with schema separation.  
- Standardized DB deployments via Liquibase integrated into CI/CD.

### **Cloud Migration with NGINX Reverse Proxy**
- Led migration from legacy domain to cloud infrastructure with reverse proxy‑based traffic redirection.  
- Ensured uninterrupted access and preserved SEO despite domain transition.
